Hi! This is my first post in a long time, I'm recreating my blog and personal website. I plan to write more blog posts about projects I'm working on, so check in every once in a while. 

I spent last weekend at Bitcamp 2016, at UMD College Park. It was an interesting experience, being the largest and most competitive hackathon I've attended by far. A lot of hackers took to making VR hacks, as the event was sponsored by Oculus (UMD is Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe's alma mater, they've named the CS school after him), and they brought a lot of hardware along.

My team was considering making a VR hack, but we eventually decided against it and made our own hardware hack, called fi(n)do. fi(n)do acts like a seeing eye dog for visually-impaired people, and consists of an iRobot Create 2, Raspberry Pi, and a Foscam wireless camera. You can read more about it on our [devpost][devpostlink] or our [Github repo][github].
